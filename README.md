# FreeCAD-documentation
An experiment to reconstruct the FreeCAD documentation in a more sustainable, markdown-based way

TODO:

1. Define a better structure than the user hub / power user hub / developers hub of the wiki? Are these hubs entirely necessary?
2. Define how to cope with the command reference
3. Link with docbook (will create the "book workflow" automatically)
4. Check how translation systems can handle this: crowdin (preferred), transifex?
5. Define a strategy for migration
