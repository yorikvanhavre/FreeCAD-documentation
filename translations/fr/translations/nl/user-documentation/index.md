**To be replaced by README.md**

This area is the main help area of FreeCAD. It contains the user-oriented documentation of FreeCAD. Documentation related to macros, python scripting and advanced customization can be found in the [power-user-hub](../power-user-hub/index.md).

S'il vous plaît noter que, comme FreeCAD lui-même, ces pages sont en développement continu. FreeCAD already features many interesting tools for the final user, and more are continuously added, which is why at the moment there is still missing or outdated documentation for the end user.

Mais ne vous découragez pas, parcourez le contenu de cette section, et, si vous ne trouvez pas l'information dont vous avez besoin, n'hésitez pas à demander! Parmi les développeurs ou dans la communauté d'utilisateurs de FreeCAD, petite mais croissante, il y aura certainement quelqu'un qui pourra vous aider. Vous pouvez laisser des commentaires sur ce site de documentation wiki sur le forum d'aide de FreeCAD et y poser vos questions.

Et si vous avez des informations que vous aimeriez voir apparaître ici, pourquoi ne pas contribuer et nous aider à faire évoluer ce manuel. Dirigez-vous vers la page Aide FreeCAD, qui vous aidera à démarrer.

Si vous souhaitez savoir comment le développement de FreeCAD a commencé il y a des années, visitez la page Historique.

## Workbenches

These are the base workbenches bundled with every installation of FreeCAD:

    Workbench Arch.png The Arch Workbench for working with architectural elements.
    Workbench Complete.png The Complete Workbench hold all commands and features from all the modules and workbenches which met certain quality criteria.
    Workbench Draft.png The Draft Workbench contains 2D tools and basic 2D and 3D CAD operations.
    Workbench Drawing.png The Drawing Workbench for displaying your 3D work on a 2D sheet.
    
    Workbench FEM.png The FEM Workbench provides Finite Element Analysis (FEA) workflow.
    Workbench Image.png The Image Workbench for working with bitmap images.
    Workbench Inspection.png The Inspection Workbench is made to give you specific tools for examination of shapes. It is still in development.
    Workbench Mesh.png The Mesh Workbench for working with triangulated meshes.
    Workbench OpenSCAD.png The OpenSCAD Workbench for interoperability with OpenSCAD and repairing Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) model history.
    Workbench Part.png The Part Workbench for working with CAD parts.
    Workbench PartDesign.png The Part Design Workbench for building Part shapes from sketches.
    Workbench Path.png The Path Workbench is used to produce G-Code instructions. It is still in a stage of development. Only basic functions in 0.16
    Workbench Plot.png The Plot Workbench is used to edit and save output plots created from other modules and tools.
    Workbench Points.png The Points Workbench for working with point clouds.
    Workbench Raytracing.png The Raytracing Workbench for working with ray-tracing (rendering)
    Workbench Reverse Engineering.png The Reverse Engineering Workbench is intended to give you specific tools to convert shapes/solids/meshes into parametric FreeCAD-compatible features. It is still in development.
    Workbench Robot.png The Robot Workbench for studying robot movements.
    Workbench Ship.png The Ship Workbench FreeCAD-Ship works over Ship entities, that must be created on top of provided geometry.
    Workbench Sketcher.png The Sketcher Workbench for working with geometry-constrained sketches.
    Workbench Spreadsheet.png The Spreadsheet Workbench for creating and manipulating spreadsheet data.
    Workbench Start.png The Start Center Workbench allows you to quickly jump to one of the most common workbenches.
    Workbench TechDraw.png The TechDraw Workbench is the more advanced and feature-rich successor of Drawing
    Workbench Test.png The Test Framework Workbench is for debugging FreeCAD.
    Workbench Web.png The Web Workbench provides you with a browser window instead of the 3D-View within FreeCAD.
    

## External Workbenches

Power users have extended FreeCAD with various custom external workbenches, that are not integrated into the FreeCAD source code, but are easy to install on an existing FreeCAD installation. See here for an overview of the already available workbenches. For instructions how to install these workbenches refer to the tutorial How to install additional workbenches. Macros

Power users have written various macros to enhance FreeCAD with more capabilities for a list of the macros refer to the page macros recipes. For instructions how to install the macros refer to the tutorial How to install macros. Reference

    Commands Reference: A complete list of the available FreeCAD commands.
    

## Online Help

This is the official FreeCAD online help. Please note that the whole online help system is currently in rework. It will be used to generate a .CHM file, that will be distributed with the binary packages of FreeCAD. At the moment the online help summarizes some of the most complete sections of this wiki.
