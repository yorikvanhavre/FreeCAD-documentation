# Documentación del usuario de FreeCAD

Esta área es la principal área de ayuda para el uso normal de FreeCAD. It doesn't contain documentation relative to python scripting or application development, which are located in other sections.

You will find here:

* Información general [acerca de FreeCAD](about.md), sus [principales características], y [cómo empezar].
* Workbenches documentation, including general description and documentation for each command found in it
* Tutorials
* Additional information about external workbenches

Please note that like FreeCAD itself, these pages are in continuous development. FreeCAD already features many interesting tools for the final user, and more are continuously added, which is why you might still find missing or outdated documentation here.

But don't feel discouraged, browse the contents of this section, and, if you cannot find the information you need, don't hesitate to ask! Among the developers or in the small but growing FreeCAD users community, there will certainly be someone who can help you. You can leave comments related to this wiki documentation site on the FreeCAD help forum and ask your questions there.

And if you have some information you would like to appear here, why not contribute and help us make this manual grow. Head to the Help FreeCAD page, that will help you to get started.

If you would like to know how the development of FreeCAD has started years ago visit the History page.
